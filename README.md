## What?
**IoT + E-Ink = IoTink**

IoTink is a portable dashboard using an e-paper display and is connected to the
Internet. It is currently utilized to fetch public transport departures and
weather predictions from a
[web service](https://github.com/platisd/vasttrafik-google-assistant) but could
be easily repurposed to accomodate different use cases.

## Why?
IoTink is ideal for times when you need to fetch information via WiFi and display
them on a screen, but it is not feasible to install power cables.

As long as you do not need real-time or frequent updates, IoTink should be
able to remain powered up on 4 AA batteries for a while.

## How?
The concept is rather straightforward, with an ESP8266 microcontroller fetching
data over WiFi and displaying them on the e-paper screen. Then it goes to
deep sleep until it is time to ome back online and fetch updated data.

On a hardware level, things are kept simple, with a minimum ESP8266 circuit that
enables us to program the chip when necessary via UART. 2+2 AA batteries are
supplying just enough voltage for the microcontroller to operate seamlessly.
